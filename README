Qore openldap module

INTRODUCTION
------------
The Qore openldap module provides LDAP functionality to Qore by using the
openldap (http://www.openldap.org) client library to provide a Qore API to
talk to LDAP servers.

The LDAP API is standard but this module was specifically designed to compile
and link with the openldap APIs and has not been tested with other LDAP APIs.

see docs for more information


LICENSE
-------
This module is released under a choice of two licenses: LGPL 2.1 and MIT, see
COPYING.LGPL and COPYING.MIT for more information


BUILDING
--------
Requires qore 0.8.7+ and openssl headers and libraries to build and run

to configure the build, execute
        configure --disable-debug

if the qore library cannot be found, then you can use:
        configure --disable-debug --with-qore=<dir>

if the openldap library or headers cannot be found, then you can use:
        configure --disable-debug --with-openldap=<dir>

(or set the OPENLDAP_DIR environment variable before callinf configure)

The qore binary also needs to be in the path so configure can determine the module directory

Then execute

make && make install

(or 'make && sudo make install' as needed)
